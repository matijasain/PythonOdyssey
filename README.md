# Python Odyssey

Python learning path.


All in all my goal is to have fun while learning using various resources and trying to complete various projects ideas.


### Projects:
[Interactive Dictionary](https://github.com/matijasain/PythonOdyssey/tree/master/InteractiveDictionary)
* Made based on tutorial *The Python Mega Course* - Interactive *Console* dictionary where you can input certain words and receive their clarification.



### Prerequisites

List of so far used tutorials and resources:
* [The Python Mega Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-python-mega-course/)


### Virtual Environment

For some of the projects (Django projects mostly) I suggest setting up vitual environment.
There is a really good and easy to follow article about this which I reccomend in case you are setting Python environment for the first time.
